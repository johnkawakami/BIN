<p>This text editor uses the markdown computer language to convert human-readable
text into html.<p>
<p>To edit text, type it into the left pane.  A preview appears to the right.  The resultant HTML code (which you can paste into a website's input box) is above.</p>

<p>To learn more about markdown <a href="http://howtomarkdown.com/">read this cheatsheet</a>.</p>
<p>The main advantage of markdown is that, in its simplest form, you cannot
easily produce bad html.  Erroneous markdown is overlooked, and the resultant
html code is still valid.</p>
<p>The advantages of this particular web-based editor are as follows
<ol>
<li>input is auto-saved every minute</li>
<li>there's a live preview</li>
<li>the "copy html code" button puts the code into your clipboard</li>
</ol>


<p>Note: this app is designed for firefox and nothing else.</p>

Everything is simple until you need to make links and images.  Those are almost as complex as HTML linking.

[links are tricky](http://slaptech.net). You [brace] the link text, and then put (parens) around the URL.

![images are like links](http://la.indymedia.org/images/LAIndycirc-08Thumb2.jpg) 

Images are like links, except that a ! precedes the link.
